# Global Hotkeys Spotify
This application will control your Spotify playback using Global Hotkeys.

Playback controls
Play/Pause
Next Track
Prev Track
Volume Up (next release)
Volume Down (next release)
Toast notification (Future)


## Installation
Go to Releases and install the msi package. Now open 'Spotify tauri' (Yes, I will change the name and icon)

## Usage
Login using your spotify credentials. Please ignore the initial error message that says 'failed'.

Test your spotify credentials are working using the buttons that play/pause, next track and prev track. NOTE: THERE MUST BE AN ACTIVE PLAYBACK FOR IT TO WORK. SO IF IT DOESN'T WORK, OPEN SPOTIFY AND PLAY A SONG.

Now, add your global hotkey combinations and hit Save

Enjoy!

Please report any issues, this is still super early in development and I'm trying to learn Rust with this project
